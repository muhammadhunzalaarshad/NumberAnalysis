# NumberAnalysis

This repository contains a Python script that performs number analysis, including primality testing, factor finding, and least common multiple (LCM) calculation for integers provided in an input file.

## Features
- **Primality Testing**: Determines if each number is prime.
- **Factor Analysis**: Finds all factors of each number and counts them.
- **LCM Calculation**: Computes the least common multiple of all numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **File I/O**: Reads numbers from `numbers.txt` and writes results to `output.txt`.
- **Error Handling**: Manages invalid inputs, empty files, negative/zero numbers, and missing files.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses standard library modules: `functools`, `typing`)

## Usage
1. Create a file named `numbers.txt` in the same directory as the script.
2. Add one integer per line in `numbers.txt`. For example:
   ```
   12
   7
   18
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python number_analysis.py
   ```
4. Check the generated `output.txt` for results. Example output:
   ```
   Number: 12, Prime: No, Factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], Factor count: 6
   Number: 7, Prime: Yes, Factors: [1, 7], Factor count: 2
   Number: 18, Prime: No, Factors: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18], Factor count: 6
   LCM of all numbers: 252
   ```

## Error Handling
- If `numbers.txt` is missing, the script outputs: `Error: numbers.txt file not found`.
- If the file is empty or contains invalid numbers, it outputs: `Error: File is empty or contains no valid numbers`.
- If negative or zero numbers are included, it outputs: `Error: File contains negative or zero numbers`.

## Files
- `number_analysis.py`: The main Python script.
- `numbers.txt`: Input file (create manually with numbers).
- `output.txt`: Output file (generated by the script).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NumberAnalysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd NumberAnalysis
   ```
3. Run the script as described in the Usage section.
